# Arduino-Product

Developed a glove with push buttons that play various musical notes when each button is pushed.

Used Arduino and a MIDI converter to connect the glove to a laptop.

Create a program using Arduino code for the buttons to play different notes.

The buttons being pressed are registered in the Arduino hardware which is then sent to a MIDI converter which sends a MIDI signal to the laptop to play a certain note.
